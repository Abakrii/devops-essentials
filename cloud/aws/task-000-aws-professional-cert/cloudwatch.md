[Monitoring deployments with Amazon CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/monitoring-cloudwatch-events.html)

```bash
The following are some use cases:
Use a Lambda function to pass a notification to a Slack channel whenever deployments fail.
Push data about deployments or instances to a Kinesis stream to support comprehensive, real-time status monitoring.
Use CloudWatch alarm actions to automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover Amazon EC2 instances when a deployment or instance event you specify occurs.
