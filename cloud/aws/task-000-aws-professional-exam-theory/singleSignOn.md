# Single Sign-On

## Connect to your Microsoft AD directory

[Connect to your Microsoft AD directory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/manage-your-identity-source-ad.html)

- With AWS Single Sign-On, administrators can connect their self-managed Active Directory (AD) or their AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory using AWS Directory Service. 
- This Microsoft AD directory defines the pool of identities that administrators can pull from when using the AWS SSO console to assign single sign-on (SSO) access. 
- After connecting their corporate directory to AWS SSO, administrators can then grant their AD users or groups access to AWS accounts, cloud applications, or both.
