[Cheat Sheet - AWS WAF](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-waf)

- AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
- AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that control bot traffic and block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
- You can also customize rules that filter out specific traffic patterns.
