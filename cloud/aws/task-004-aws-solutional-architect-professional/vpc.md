## Network ACLs

[Network ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html)

- A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. 
- You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.
