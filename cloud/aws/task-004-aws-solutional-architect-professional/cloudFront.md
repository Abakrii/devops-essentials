[What is Amazon CloudFront?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html)

Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

- If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.

- If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've definedâ€”such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel, or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.


## Restricting the geographic distribution of your content

[Restricting the geographic distribution of your content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/georestrictions.html)

You can use geo restriction, also known as geo blocking, to prevent users in specific geographic locations from accessing content that you're distributing through a CloudFront distribution. To use geo restriction, you have two options:

- Use the CloudFront geo restriction feature. Use this option to restrict access to all of the files that are associated with a distribution and to restrict access at the country level.

- Use a third-party geolocation service. Use this option to restrict access to a subset of the files that are associated with a distribution or to restrict access at a finer granularity than the country level.

## Optimizing Caching and availability

### Optimizing high availability with CloudFront origin failover

[Optimizing high availability with CloudFront origin failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/high_availability_origin_failover.html)


- You can set up CloudFront with origin failover for scenarios that require high availability. 
- To get started, you create an origin group with two origins: a primary and a secondary. 
- If the primary origin is unavailable, or returns specific HTTP response status codes that indicate a failure, CloudFront automatically switches to the secondary origin.
