[Enabling SAML 2.0 federated users to access the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html)

- You can use a role to configure your SAML 2.0-compliant identity provider (IdP) and AWS to permit your federated users to access the AWS Management Console. 
- The role grants the user permissions to carry out tasks in the console.


## Logging IAM and AWS STS API calls with AWS CloudTrail

[Logging IAM and AWS STS API calls with AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html)

- IAM and AWS STS are integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by an IAM user or role.
- CloudTrail captures all API calls for IAM and AWS STS as events, including calls from the console and from API calls. 
- If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket. 
- If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history
