[Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html)

- You can use the Amazon S3 Event Notifications feature to receive notifications when certain events happen in your S3 bucket.
- To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications.
- You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket.
