## Amazon S3 Event Notifications

[Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html)

- You can use the Amazon S3 Event Notifications feature to receive notifications when certain events happen in your S3 bucket.
- To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications.
- You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket.

### Replicating objects

[Replicating objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html)

- Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets
- Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts.
- Objects may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. 
- By default, replication only supports copying new Amazon S3 objects after it is enabled. 
- You can use replication to copy existing objects and clone them to a different bucket, but in order to do so, you must contact AWS Support Center
