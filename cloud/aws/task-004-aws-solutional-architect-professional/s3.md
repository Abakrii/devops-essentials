[What is Amazon S3?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)

## Amazon S3 Event Notifications

[Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html)

- You can use the Amazon S3 Event Notifications feature to receive notifications when certain events happen in your S3 bucket.
- To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications.
- You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket.

### Replicating objects

[Replicating objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html)

- Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets
- Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts.
- Objects may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. 
- By default, replication only supports copying new Amazon S3 objects after it is enabled. 
- You can use replication to copy existing objects and clone them to a different bucket, but in order to do so, you must contact AWS Support Center

## Server Side Encryption

### Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)

[Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html)

- Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. 
- Server-side encryption encrypts only the object data, not object metadata.
- Using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) allows you to set your own encryption keys
- The only thing you do is manage the encryption keys you provide.

## Working with Buckets

### Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage

[Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.html)

- In general, bucket owners pay for all Amazon S3 storage and data transfer costs that are associated with their bucket. 
- However, you can configure a bucket to be a Requester Pays bucket. 
- With Requester Pays buckets, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket.


### Using versioning in S3 buckets

[Using versioning in S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html)

- Versioning in Amazon S3 is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. 
- You can use the S3 Versioning feature to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your buckets.
