- Nearly all enterprises, regardless of industry, have to store files, whether they are backups, media content, or files generated by specialized industry applications.
- You can choose from two file gateway types for your latency-sensitive applications and workloads that require local caching and file protocol access. 
  - Amazon S3 File Gateway enables you to store file data as objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage for data lakes, backups, and ML workflows. 
  - For user or team file shares, and file-based application migrations, Amazon FSx File Gateway provides low-latency, on-premises access to fully managed file shares in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

## Tape Gateway

- Tape Gateway enables you to replace using physical tapes on premises with virtual tapes in AWS without changing existing backup workflows.
- Tape Gateway encrypts data between the gateway and AWS for secure data transfer, and compresses data and transitions virtual tapes between Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier, or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, to minimize storage costs.
- you can't directly fetch the media files from your tape gateway in real-time since this is backed up using Glacier.
